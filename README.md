# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification - CodeAlpha Task 1

### 📝 Project Overview
[cite_start]This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at @CodeAlpha**[cite: 4, 22]. [cite_start]The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into three species: **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica** based on their sepal and petal measurements[cite: 24, 26].

### 📊 Key Features
* [cite_start]**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data patterns using Seaborn and Matplotlib[cite: 35].
* [cite_start]**Pre-processing:** Scaling features for better model performance[cite: 7].
* [cite_start]**Modeling:** Built using **K-Neighbors Classifier** and **Logistic Regression**[cite: 61, 195].
* [cite_start]**Evaluation:** Achieved **100% Accuracy** on test data[cite: 171].

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* [cite_start]**Language:** Python 
* [cite_start]**Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Seaborn [cite: 28, 51]

### 📈 Results
The model successfully identifies flower species with a perfect score. Below is the classification report summary:
- [cite_start]**Precision:** 1.00 [cite: 174]
- [cite_start]**Recall:** 1.00 [cite: 174]
- [cite_start]**Accuracy:** 100% [cite: 171]
